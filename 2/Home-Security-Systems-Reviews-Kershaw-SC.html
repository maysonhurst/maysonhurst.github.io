<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader location and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Vivint is an excellent choice for those searching for a clever home security system that incorporates cost-effective, energy-efficient technology.
