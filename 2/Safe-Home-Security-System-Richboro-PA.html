<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This unit is what interacts with all of the security sensors and smart-home elements in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more flexible. When they open, contact sensing units are the very first thing you ought to buy along with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will alert you. Other home security components include motion sensing units, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensing units, and panic buttons.</p>
