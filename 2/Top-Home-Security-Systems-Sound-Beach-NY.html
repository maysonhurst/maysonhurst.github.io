<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
