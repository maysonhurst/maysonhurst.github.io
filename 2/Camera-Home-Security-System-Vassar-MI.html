<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. Due to the fact that it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is truly fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
