For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make consumers stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated hub included here - each camera links directly to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.
