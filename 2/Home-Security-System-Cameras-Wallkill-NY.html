<p>The best in smart home security systems. As you can see from our picks, much of the top-rated home security cameras on the marketplace are roughly in the $200 range, and a few of them also need an extra cost to shop tape-recorded video in the cloud. We break down any extra charges in our reviews, so it's worth having a look at each to learn which one fits your budget.

<p>It's becoming more popular. However for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that offers two-way audio, go all out.

This also depends on the provider, but you can expect signing an agreement with suppliers who need professional installation of their systems. The typical length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some contracts could span as much as 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend considering a DIY home security system rather if you want to prevent having to sign an agreement.</p>
