<p>One classification where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer service.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
