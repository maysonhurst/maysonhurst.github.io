<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary advantages like person detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked only about half of the camera and the time routinely detached from the network multiple times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine).
