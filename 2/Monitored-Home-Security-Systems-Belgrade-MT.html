<p>As you simply learned, there are two broad classifications of security cameras.

The second category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically starts at about $400 (US) per camera-- a significantly higher cost.

<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very easy to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile phones.

But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a wise smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
