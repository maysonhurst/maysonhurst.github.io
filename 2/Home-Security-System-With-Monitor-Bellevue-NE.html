<p>Blink cameras are compact, include complimentary storage, and use two AA batteries that can last up to 2 years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.

If trespassers can not see any security cameras, they may likewise be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
