<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal construction.
