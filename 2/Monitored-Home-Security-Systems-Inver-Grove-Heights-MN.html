The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the malicious enemy to tape-record these codes and use different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system.
