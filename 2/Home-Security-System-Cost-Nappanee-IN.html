<p>CCTV cameras are much better at catching crooks after they have committed a criminal offense, rather than having the ability to stop a criminal offense in progress. Somebody has to be actively watching the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to try to detect criminal activity before it happens. Having a a great deal of visible CCTV cameras in public areas might serve as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being shot, though probably not enjoyed.</p>
