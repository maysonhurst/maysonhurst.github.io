<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often exceptionally high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in many cases) and sounds an alarm with an expert monitoring company. The control panel communicates with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, window and door sensors, and motion sensors, to spot an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, getting in touch with you and alerting the authorities.</p>

Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the components you are trying to find in the taped video footage.
