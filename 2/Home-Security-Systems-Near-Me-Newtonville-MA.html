<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
