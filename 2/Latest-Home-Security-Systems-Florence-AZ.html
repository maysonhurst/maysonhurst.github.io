<p>Thanks to recent improvements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you should consider the following benefits of wireless technology. The $260 Basics plan includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensor, a yard indication, and 2 window decals. For $15 monthly, you can include around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline.
