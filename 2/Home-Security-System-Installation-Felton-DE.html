The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's restroom. If a patient is having problem, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is normally open or generally closed.
