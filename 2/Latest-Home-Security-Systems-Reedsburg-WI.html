<p>CCTV cameras are better at capturing criminals after they have dedicated a criminal activity, rather than having the ability to stop a criminal offense in development.

Having a large number of noticeable CCTV cameras in public areas may act as some level of deterrent, knowing you are being recorded, though probably not enjoyed.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing multiple sensors to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources.

A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch right away. This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>

If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent.
