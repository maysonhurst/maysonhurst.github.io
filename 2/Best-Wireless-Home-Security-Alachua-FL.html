Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
