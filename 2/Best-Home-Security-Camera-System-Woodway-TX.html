<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the producer's statistics because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a need to for use when you're away from home, however you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and disarm the system.

When you include other Ring products to Call Alarm it ends up being a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way communication, and wise lighting. Of course, at that point, the cheap price becomes more costly.</p>
