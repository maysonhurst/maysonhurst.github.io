<p>Our burglar alarms might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an infraction. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
