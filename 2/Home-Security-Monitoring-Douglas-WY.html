<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
