When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cables. DVR systems are difficult to scale up since as soon as every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to buy a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the linked cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
