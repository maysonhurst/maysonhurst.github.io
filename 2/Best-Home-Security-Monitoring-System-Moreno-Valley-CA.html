The designs we've reviewed so far either record very short clips, leave huge spaces in between those short clips, or require charging on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Another crucial subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much suffices. In this article, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image.
