Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
