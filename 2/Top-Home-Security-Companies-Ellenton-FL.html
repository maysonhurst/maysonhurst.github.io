These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless means the camera is wire-free.

<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Occupants, unlike homeowners, normally avoid making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also enable remote control of the system and basic home automation.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
