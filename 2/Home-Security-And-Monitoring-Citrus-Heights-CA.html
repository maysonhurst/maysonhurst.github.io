<p>Nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This unit is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced smart home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

Home security is extremely crucial, so don't be tempted to take any shortcuts when it pertains to selecting a model.
