<p>The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide attackers are plainly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far exceeds the restricted advantages that the system may supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
