<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
