<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

Because contract-based security systems generally don't come with upfront costs. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts!
