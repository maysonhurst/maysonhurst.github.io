We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts!

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level.

HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
