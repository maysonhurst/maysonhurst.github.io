IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP represents internet protocol) network, often the very same data network the rest of a company utilizes. A separate network utilizing category 5 electrical wiring can be used if bandwidth is a problem. Either way, video info is tape-recorded on a server, which suggests video information can be found on website or in a remote location. After testing, we sent each of our top picks, in addition to the Wyze Camera v2, to Costs McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing.

<h2>The Major Weakness Of Using A CCTV Security System Earlimart</h2>
<p>Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems.

While improvements over the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
