IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP represents internet protocol) network, often the very same data network the rest of a company utilizes.

After testing, we sent each of our top picks, in addition to the Wyze Camera v2, to Costs McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing.

<h2>The Major Weakness Of Using A CCTV Security System Earlimart</h2>
