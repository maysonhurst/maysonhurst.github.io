<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.

<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control board (typically positioned in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have been triggered, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly irritating your neighbours).

As such, even if someone burglarize your home in total darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your smart device app. The only problem here is that the taped video footage will be black and white and a little dark so you may not be able to see information plainly.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control belongs to the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface offers extra details that may never ever have actually been possible in the past, such as notice of an employee, by name and recognition number, going into the building.
