<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more know-how to setup, and usually cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensors communicate with a control board.

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity avoidance developed to avoid both individual and property crime and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a particular location of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will decrease criminal offense and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other nearby locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Wireless systems are typically more user-friendly, and they can offer a more gratifying experience in general.

For example, you can have a clever plug turn on a light indoors or trigger an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
