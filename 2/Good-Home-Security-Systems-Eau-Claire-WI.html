<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are difficult to scale up since when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy a totally new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on produced to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
