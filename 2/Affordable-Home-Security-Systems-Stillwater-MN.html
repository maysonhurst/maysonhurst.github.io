<p>Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems.

Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason why.</p>

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also great metal construction.
