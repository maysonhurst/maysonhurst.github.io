<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
