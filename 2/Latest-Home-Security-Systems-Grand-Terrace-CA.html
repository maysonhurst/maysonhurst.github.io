Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
