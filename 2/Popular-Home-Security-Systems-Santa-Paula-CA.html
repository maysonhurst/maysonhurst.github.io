<p>We also like that Ring still has good wise home assistance. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your wise outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly easy.

ADT likewise deals with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 careful people with smartphones is much better security than one security individual watching 10,000 individuals on CCTV.</p>
<p>The 2nd wireless function has to do with how your security system interacts with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would utilize a home phone line to dial out" and interact with the alarm monitoring station. However, lots of households no longer use a phone line in their home. So, how do we get your alarm to interact with the monitoring station? Much in the same way you do - we can link through the internet or by means of a wireless cellular phone signal.</p>
