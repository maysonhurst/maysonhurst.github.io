<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
