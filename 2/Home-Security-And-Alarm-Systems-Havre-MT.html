Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>We searched for DIY systems that provided expert monitoring, both with and without a contract.
