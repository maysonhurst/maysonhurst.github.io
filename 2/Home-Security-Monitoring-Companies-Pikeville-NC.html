<p>While not a vital requirement for a home security system, all top companies provide a range of camera choices as add-ons. House owners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape video when an alarm is set off, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be integrated into the general system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm is valuable. Although there are a variety of extra system elements available including smoke detectors and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm consists of 3 main parts: a keypad control panel, specific sensing units, and a manned monitoring station.</p>

Home alarm systems monitored with a conventional landline don't need power to work. Even if you run out power for days, the system should still have the ability to call for help.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the problem. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, our company believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>
<p>Downsides: extremely sensitive to weather; as fog, snow, and rain, for instance, would trigger the sensing units to stop working, and need sterilized perimeter line since bushes and trees or anything that obstructs the beam would cause false alarm or absence of detection.
