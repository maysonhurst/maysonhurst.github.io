<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should offer at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to correctly discover motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with recording gaps during important security events.

<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, portability and expandability.

Wireless security strategies likewise allow push-button control of the system and general home automation.
