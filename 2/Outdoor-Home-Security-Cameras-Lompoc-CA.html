<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years!
