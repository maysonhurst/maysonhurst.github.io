<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
