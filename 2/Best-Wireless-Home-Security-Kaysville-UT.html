<p>The majority of the cameras we checked require an AC outlet, so positioning is certainly an aspect. A few models use batteries, making positioning more versatile, but this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors section. Wi-Fi protection also affects where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or adding an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smartphone or laptop computer gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to mount the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>

<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it includes individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, less incorrect notifies.

(We think this is a more valuable function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not required, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
