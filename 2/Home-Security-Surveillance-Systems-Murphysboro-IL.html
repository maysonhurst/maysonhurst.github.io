<p>Nurse calling systems generally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a client is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is generally open or usually closed.

Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
