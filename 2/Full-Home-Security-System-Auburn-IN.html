<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and reduce crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video to the cloud.
