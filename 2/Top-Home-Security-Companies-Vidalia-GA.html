<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for example, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was caught using police databases to gather information on patrons of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he attempted to blackmail clients who were married. Imagine what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
