<p>As you simply discovered, there are 2 broad categories of security cameras. What you typically find at shops are consumer-grade cameras, which generally come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and cost less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set. The 2nd category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, usually starts at about $400 (US) per camera-- a substantially greater cost. The video recorder must be bought separately, and commercial grade recorders start at about $500 (United States $) and can range approximately $5000 depending upon the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing functions.</p>
