<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, need to offer a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to appropriately detect motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with taping spaces during crucial security occasions. If home security is your main concern, we 'd recommend one of our top picks, but the Arlo is great for signing in on household and family pets-- or roaming felines sliding around your yard.</p>
