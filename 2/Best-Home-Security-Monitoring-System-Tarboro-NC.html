<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and absolutely like it. Great clarity. I wished to establish viewing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company.

However, those functions come at a comparatively high price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.
