<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
<h3>Full Home Security System in Oklahoma</h3>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it must be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same membership model and exact same app as the original Nest Camera Outdoor, but it includes more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), much better audio, a stronger install, and a larger operating temperature variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's likewise more tamper-proof than any of our other choices, but that included security produces a more difficult installation process, and it costs almost twice the price of the Nest Camera Outdoor.</p>
