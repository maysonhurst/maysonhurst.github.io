It acts as the brains of the system, connecting with sensors and third party-devices via Z-Wave and managing them utilizing the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo excels is client service.

Unlike with analogue cameras, information such as number plates are quickly readable. At 11 Mpix, forensic quality images are made where each hand on an individual can be identified.
