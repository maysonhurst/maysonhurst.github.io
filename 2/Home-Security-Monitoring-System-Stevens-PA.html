<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
