Now, a lot of security systems include a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, glass, motion, and entry break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, to name a few parts.

<p>Besides resolution, also think about the field of view. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, however not all angles are produced equal. Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone. You must consider a camera with a really large field of view if you desire to view a big area. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a great property as well.</p>

However, there work countermeasures (like disabling open switchports during switch configuration and VLAN configuration to restrict network access) that are available to protect both the network and the information it includes, but such countermeasures should be used consistently to all network devices.</p>

The alarm system doesn't include a wifi security camera but you can acquire a variety of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional extras.
