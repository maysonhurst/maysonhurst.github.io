<p>Think of it by doing this, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It just does not accumulate. To offer such low prices, producers need to cut corners, and the end outcome is jeopardized performance. What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in perfect conditions like brilliant sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific situations such as baby-sitter cams or checking in on a pet, though when aiming to gather evidence of a crime they often lose.</p>

Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or display screen and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>
