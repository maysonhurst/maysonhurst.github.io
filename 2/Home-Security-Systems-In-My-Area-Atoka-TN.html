A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of identifying small differences in temperature level.

IP cameras can also be linked to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends information from the camera and supplies power to it.

PoE switches are likewise generally regarded as a more secure method to transmit data.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more proficiency to setup, and usually cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensors communicate with a control board.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
