<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for brief battery life by far.
