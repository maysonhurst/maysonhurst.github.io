And with Vivint Playback you get one month of continuous video recording, flexible seeing choices, and low-cost, high-capacity storage. Costly.

With prices so high, it frequently isn't worth it for homeowners to have a wired security system unless their budget is broad enough to fit the system easily.

<p>We searched for DIY systems that used professional monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies provide greatly discounted or complimentary hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some individuals may want to register for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, along with how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>
