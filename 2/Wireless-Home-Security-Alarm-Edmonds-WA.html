<p>To gauge response times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private guard. A number of cities also require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
