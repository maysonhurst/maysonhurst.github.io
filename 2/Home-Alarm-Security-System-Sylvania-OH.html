<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
