The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from items in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon info about the temperature differences.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.
