<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With basic wise home gadgets like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for potential bundle thieves or speak to visitors who drop in.</p>
