For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software application and firmware.

DVR systems are difficult to scale up since when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you require to buy a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system.
