<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disruption principle based on 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter releases continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is produced. The system is hidden after installation.
