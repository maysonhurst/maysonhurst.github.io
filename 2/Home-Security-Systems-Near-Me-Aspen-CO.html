<p>Sensors permit cameras to start and stop tape-recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does end up being a little bit of an issue is between identifying and recording motion. Due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it identifies motion.
