<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
