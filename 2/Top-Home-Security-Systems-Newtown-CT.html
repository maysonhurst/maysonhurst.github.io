<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Cameras that record large locations of the public are large in scope, tape-recording whatever and everybody within their reach. These cameras record everyone equally: the general public going about their everyday activities, and bad guys who likely protect or blend themselves in to prevent being tape-recorded or identified.
