<h3>Wireless Home Security Monitoring in Texas</h3>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
