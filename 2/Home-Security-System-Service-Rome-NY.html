<p>This clever wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when motion was discovered.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
