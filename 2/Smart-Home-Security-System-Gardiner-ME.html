<p>The Maximus Smart Security Light puts a camera right under an ordinary-looking deck light. It's not totally hidden-- it's simple enough to see if you're trying to find it-- however passersby are less likely to notice the Maximus than, say, the Ring Floodlight Webcam.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
