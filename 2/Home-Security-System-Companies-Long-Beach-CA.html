We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
