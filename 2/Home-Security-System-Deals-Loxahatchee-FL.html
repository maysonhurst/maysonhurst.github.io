The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the very same person might position a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not against the chastening code.</p>
