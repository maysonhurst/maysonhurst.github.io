<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by.
