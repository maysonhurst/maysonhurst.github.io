Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by.
