Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of as much as one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually observed some improvements considering that the camera's launch, and will continue to check and update this evaluation, as needed.</p>
