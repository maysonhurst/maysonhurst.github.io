<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon cops department personnel, needs registration, assessment of fees for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, supplies procedures for repeat transgressors, and provides an efficient date. While some vestiges of the old market stay, today's homeowners are presented with a lot more alternatives.
