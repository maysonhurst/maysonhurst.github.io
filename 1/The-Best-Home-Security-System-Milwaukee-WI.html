<h3>Home Security Protection in Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking authorities official in Washington, DC was caught using police databases to collect information on clients of a gay club. By searching for the license plate varieties of parking area at the club and investigating the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were wed.

<p>Unmonitored systems won't offer the same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smart device, there are times when you might not be in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on a plane, in an important conference, or in an area without phone reception.
