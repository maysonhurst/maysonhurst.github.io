IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network.

So much, in fact, that they require about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is important, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
