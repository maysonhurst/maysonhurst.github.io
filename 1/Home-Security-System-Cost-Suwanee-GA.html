<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range concerns.</p>

For instance, you can have a smart plug turn on a lamp inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
