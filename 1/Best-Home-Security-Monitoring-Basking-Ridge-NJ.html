Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
