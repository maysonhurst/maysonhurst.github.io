<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
