<p>Potential robbers by and big choose much easier targets with the least amount of danger involved. House owners also sometimes install phony security cameras utilizing the same thinking. It makes good sense that alarm signs alone will discourage some robbers.

<p>Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, Link, and Brinks all use smart locks, video doorbells, thermostats, and other home automation gadgets that you can manage from your smartphone. Other brands, like Ring and Nest Secure, offer a handful of cool smart devices. And some brands don't offer smart equipment of their own but do incorporate with common clever home systems. Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later.
