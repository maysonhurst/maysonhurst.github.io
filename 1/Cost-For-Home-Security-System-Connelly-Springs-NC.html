<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
