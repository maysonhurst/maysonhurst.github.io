<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
