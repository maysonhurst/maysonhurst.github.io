<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

However, those functions come at a comparatively high price: $5 monthly ($50 annually) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.
