<p>In the evening, though it lacks the full IR LED variety of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the fantastic motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's looking at. Simply a couple years back, the home security market was controlled by a couple of big names providing pricey, stiff strategies with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting contracts.
