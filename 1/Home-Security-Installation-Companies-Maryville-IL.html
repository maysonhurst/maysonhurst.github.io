<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
