<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days.

<p>Base stations are the center of a security system, utilizing WiFi and wireless innovation to link all the various sensors, cameras, and other system elements. Variety extenders are used for larger homes because the majority of base stations typically just have a range of a couple hundred feet. Night vision.
