They offer versatility in their equipment and offered plans, enabling property owners to select the security solution that best suits their requirements. Regrettably, there are some drawbacks to Secure America suggested by their low C- ranking from BBB. A majority of the problems center around misinformation regarding the obligatory 3 year contract. In fact, a lot of consumers were not mindful they were making such a long term commitment. This, combined with the severe penalty for early cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may give some time out in choosing Protect America as their home security option.</p>

<p>Video and image feeds have shown invaluable for surveillance - but there's space for more functionality by utilizing audio.

While it's more expensive than many other cameras, the general quality of the Arlo Pro 3 helps make up the distinction in cost.</p>
