<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to theft reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
