Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers support cops action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  method to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>

When a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
