<p>What's not to like about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and includes a lots of crucial features we haven't seen in a single camera (or at all) in the past. SimpliSafe creates and sells its own devices. The quality of this equipment seems acceptable to a lot of users, though it can't be utilized with a various monitoring service like third-party equipment might.
