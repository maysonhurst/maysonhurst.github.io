<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
