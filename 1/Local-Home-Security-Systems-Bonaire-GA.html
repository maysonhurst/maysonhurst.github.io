Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by.
