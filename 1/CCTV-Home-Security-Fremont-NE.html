<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's statistics because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
