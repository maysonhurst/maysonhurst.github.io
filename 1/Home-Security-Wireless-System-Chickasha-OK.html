The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly fee ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to effectively identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording gaps during important security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise one of our top picks, however the Arlo is excellent for signing in on family and family pets-- or stray felines slinking around your yard.</p>
