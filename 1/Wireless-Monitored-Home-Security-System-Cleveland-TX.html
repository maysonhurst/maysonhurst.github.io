<h3>Wireless Home Security Cameras in Texas</h3>
<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
