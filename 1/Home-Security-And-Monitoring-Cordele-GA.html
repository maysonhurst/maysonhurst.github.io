The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to record video and see it later on.
