<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, vandalism, and theft. Idea: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms.
