<p>Unmonitored alarm systems do not connect to professional monitoring. Rather, they sound an alarm to let you know there is an issue and after that allows you to act.

<p>Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the web and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
