<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is activated. Nevertheless, you may select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the client.</p>
<p>Because the glass housing does not get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they offset it in capabilities. In addition to being fantastic for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared considering that the glass housing does not impede the lens. With some, it's difficult to inform at a glance where they've been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their true field of view. Installing a video surveillance system with a few of these is a great choice for a number of various configurations.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
