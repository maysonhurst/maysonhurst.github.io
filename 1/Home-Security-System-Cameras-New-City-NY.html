<p>Ring might not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually gained quite the excitement throughout the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security package that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees.

<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it consists of all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few extra entry sensors. Ring advises this bundle for homes with as much as two bed rooms and around 2,000 square feet. We've also attempted to restrict this list to cameras that can provide informs that are trustworthy and actually useful - if your camera is pinging your phone whenever a leaf blows previous, you're quickly going to get sick of having to inspect it.</p>

GO2 has a complete variety of Low Light, Night Vision and Infra-Red Cameras for your business or house that give you the peace of mind to be able to view your video during the night or poor ecological conditions.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of this alarm is that it has a very innovative motion sensor.

If your motion sensor is activated, you get a notification in your smart device app. There's no latency so you get notified instantly so you can take instant actions such as triggering a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the possible burglars.</p>

We also like that Vivint offers you the option to buy your equipment outright, which implies you're off the hook for a long-lasting contract-- but that does require a significant up-front payment.</p>
