Almost all standalone security cameras link to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and the majority of have integrated sensors that find motion and noise and will send out push and e-mail notices when those sensors are set off. You can normally fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to avoid false alarms due to family pet activity or passing vehicles if the camera is near a window, and you can produce a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off throughout certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
