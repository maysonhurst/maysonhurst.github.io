Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute considerably to police capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities response to alarmed properties) a ineffective and costly method to burglary decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
