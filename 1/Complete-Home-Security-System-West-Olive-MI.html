<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
