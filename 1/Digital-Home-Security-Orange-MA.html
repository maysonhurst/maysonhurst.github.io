<h3>Home Security Monitoring in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it discovers an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the device to function as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant. Security combined with wise home automation develops the most reputable, innovative home security possible. It's why we establish wise home tech products and integrate with smart items from companies like Google and Amazon. A wise home is a secure home.</p>
