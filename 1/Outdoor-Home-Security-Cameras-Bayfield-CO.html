<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
