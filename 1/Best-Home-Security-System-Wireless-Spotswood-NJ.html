<p>What's not to love about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and includes a ton of essential functions we have not seen in a single camera (or at all) in the past. SimpliSafe produces and offers its own gadgets.

The Circle 2 even offers a time-lapse of the day, so you can make certain you didn't miss out on something.

DVRs likewise need that the linked cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
