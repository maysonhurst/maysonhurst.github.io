The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to fix information after the truth, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of taping storage space.
