<p>ADT uses both hardwired and wireless security that is installed by a specialist for free. Professional installation makes sure that your equipment is setup properly, but you do need to allow an ADT technician into your home. Technicians get a high level of security training and can help educate you about your new system. You can acquire ADT products and services straight from the company or from an authorized independent dealer. Customer support and quality differ from dealership to dealer, so purchase from ADT straight when you can or deal with a dealer you trust. More Americans trust their home security to ADT than to any other provider.</p>
<p>For smart home features, we advise the ADT Pulse plan. It provides complete IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you from another location arm and disarm your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and control the thermostat so you never have to come home to a cold house. ADT also deals with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful residents with smartphones is much better security than one security person watching 10,000 individuals on CCTV.</p>

You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be truthful, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. What you're paying for is mainly that big name in blue.</p>
