With decades of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle services and homes, we've developed great relationships with both local police forces and their clients. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and vulnerable to exploits. It practically does not matter how strong your password is or if your software application is up to date if cybercriminals can just hijack your Wi-Fi information.

<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't come with a free tier of cloud storage, so you need to spend at least $3 each month if you wish to save any videos.
