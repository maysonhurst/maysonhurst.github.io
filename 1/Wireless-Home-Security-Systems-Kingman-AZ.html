<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
