During testing, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was discovered. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>

Be prepared to supply your new company with the documentation of prior payment.</p>
