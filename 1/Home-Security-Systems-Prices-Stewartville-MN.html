<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a learning duration).

ADT utilizes an independent supplier model involving third-party dealerships. The dealerships determine which equipment to use. Expenses for systems vary.
