<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
