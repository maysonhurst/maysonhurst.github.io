<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we may revisit this evaluation. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera gives you an excellent visual field, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
