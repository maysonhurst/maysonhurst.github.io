<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the fact, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of recording storage space. A lot, in truth, that they need about 4 times the hard disk space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage.
