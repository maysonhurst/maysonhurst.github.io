<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web procedure (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little bit more expensive, they use a number of functions that analog cameras do not.
