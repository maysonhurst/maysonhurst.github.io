<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business communications were mostly synchronous. To achieve almost anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when dealing with national and worldwide business. The very same holds true for security and video surveillance. Generally, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and somebody else, someplace, viewing video surveillance displays for support. Whatever is integrated and whatever takes place in real time.</p>
<p>The 2nd wireless function involves how your security system communicates with the alarm monitoring station.
