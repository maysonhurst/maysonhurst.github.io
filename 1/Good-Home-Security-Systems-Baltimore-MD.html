<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and various detectors all connected to a primary control panel by means of radio signals.

<p>Zoom, tilt, and pan, or PTZ cameras are a preferred amongst those looking for advanced functionality.

<p>The security systems I've designed and carried out are strictly for monitoring activity of a potential target, whether from a terrorist hazard or community burglars or vandals.

Those are different options with different requirements and goals.</p>
<p>Similar to a self-monitored alarm, an expertly monitored alarm can provide you access to your home's alarm system from an Internet-capable device, such as your office computer system or tablet. You can likewise setup alerts to be sent out when your alarm is activated or deactivated. That spotlight puts it into direct competition with something like the Ring Spotlight Web Cam Battery, though there's no battery here - you need to wire this up to a power socket inside (or outside) your home somehow. The connectivity is wireless, so the Swann Floodlight Security Camera need to have no issue linking to your Wi-Fi and pinging your phone each time it spots something suspicious.</p>
