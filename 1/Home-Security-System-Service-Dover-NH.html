<h3>Remote Home Security in New Hampshire</h3>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious opponent, because the disruption of the network prevents the circulation of data and in fact indirectly protects data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the malicious attacker to tape-record these codes and utilize different cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security key captured throughout the network recovery.</p>
