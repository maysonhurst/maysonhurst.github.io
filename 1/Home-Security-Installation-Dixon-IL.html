<p>Basically, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and various detectors all linked to a main control board through radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>
