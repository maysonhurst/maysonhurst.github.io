<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and fraud. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically switch off the heater.
